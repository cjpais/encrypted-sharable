Just jumping right into it while I have 12 minutes.

Two contracts.

1. Public Key Registry
2. Data Registry

Had a call with Dave and now back to it again.

One question is regarding the `Data` struct. Not sure the mapping of keys is
right or not. It seems maybe unecessary? Instead can just use an array?
This way we get length for free? I don't think we are planning to do a lot
on-chain in this version. It is more a storage thing. Perhaps it will be 
nice to be able to lookup? I will create a second storage variable for this?
Removing keys with an array sucks. Would be better to do it using a mapping.
Still unclear the best data structure choice here. It's possible that it
makes more sense as a separate contract in higher abstraction. The data
probably shouldnt be aware that it's encrypted at all. So that is handled
by a higher level contract.

Thinking about the functions we have here.

I think right now I am going to just do `create` and `addKey`.

Sure the contracts are mostly ready. Will probably go ahead and test
and deploy them tomorrow. After doing that I will start on the front-end.

The front end should be relatively simple for now. A button to register
your public key in the registry (sign-in).

Then all we need is a text box and a submit button for the data.

This should be minimum viable demo. I would also like to do something
like a file upload. This will encrypt the data and then upload it to
ipfs.

I guess the other part of the interface is to view and decrypt the files.
Since we have the `userAccess` thing we should be able to do this easily.
Also since we have the events it shouldn't be a huge deal. We will 
probably make a subgraph or use ponder and try to deploy it.

I left the `userData` field in for now. Will probably be creating a very
simple data structure to pack data into it for now.

something like `version(bytes1), dataEncrypted(bool)` to start, but 
i might leave room for something like `application(uint256)` 
`applicationDataLength`, and `applicationData(bytes)` as well. This will
allow prototype experiments to be made fully off chain. One would be 
an encrypted messenger on chain. The other would probably be something more
tailored to the group i am working with. Having a personal channel for myself
which may or may not be encrypted at different levels. I have an iOS app
which could do all of this directly. It would be an evolution of that
specification as well. It would stretch the limits of what that graph like
structure can handle which would be a great experiment generally to understand
how these things interact with eachother. Basically how to get graph 
composibility on chain. Need to play more games and experiments.
