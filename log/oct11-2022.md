Okay so the basic of testing and deploying the contracts is now done.

I think the next step is to try to use it in a meaningful way.

Basically going to do this first by creating a button on the website which allows you
to add your public key. It will use the metamask library under the hood. Going to look
at some sample code for this from the [Unstoppable Shop](https://github.com/pbshgthm/theunstoppableshop)

Great that was easy. Sucessfully added my public key at this [tx](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x6794d79f8220e3f8259cfc59666ca1b975c550b0aa7296fc9cee2279da9ef22a)

Now I am going to encrypt a message to myself and see if I can decrypt it.
The function will probably be something like
  1. fetch my public key from the contract (this is generic enough so it could be someone else's too, plus avoids a permissioned call into metamask)
  2. generate a 128bit AES key and encrypt it using my public key (this will require a call into metamask)
  3. call the contract with the data returned from metamask as well as the encrypted data.

## Crypto

Lol I am getting into the "don't roll your own crypto thing" now.
I am not totally satisfied with CryptoJS, but it is the lowest hanging fruit.
Using the built in Crypto API is more complex and would probably change
how I would want to write the contracts. I will probably have to understand
more about cryptography to really do the right thing. It might mean going to
the academics at UCSD.
