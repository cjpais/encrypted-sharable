Getting to work late in the afternoon on this around 3:40.

Getting back into the codebase is nice. I am planning just to simply list the messages which you have access to.
I have to do a bit of thinking how I want to do this in the UI. Each message will be decrypted and stored locally
in the browser state for the page. This is obviously a huge security hole but whatever, most browser plugins would
also be.

Wheeeww it's almost 6. Made some decent progress. A bit slow there at the end trying to get tailwind into the project.

Learned that zustand persist has a lot of limitations. Cannot use `Maps`. Using it with localStorage by default
has issues with React 18 and Next.JS. It has hydration issues. I am using some library now. It's called
`localforage`. It works for now. The hydration issues are still there sometimes, but I don't have a clear
cause of them. It looks like it might be from the autorefresh?
