Okayyyy time to get started. I am not sure where I want to start today. Maybe I can check on my railway
instance of ponder and go from there. Make sure it's updating.

Great it's updating.

## 2 Items For Today

1. Update localstorage after encrypting message. This may need new contracts to parse response, but prob not since txwait has the event data
2. Add a share thing and be able to share messages

## Got 2 working

After a struggle 2 worked. It was mainly a bunch of type issues and not sharing code. I am going
to move a bunch of components to share code which should help dramatically in errors like this. 
I wasnt sure what the types were to start and didnt want to force myself down a path, but it
might have been worth it.
