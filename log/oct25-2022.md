Mostly doing a lot of research today. Finding out about new concepts and how they could be applied

* Identity Based Encryption
  * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8989361
* Multi-Party Key Exchange
  * https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~aggelos/crypto/page4/assets/joux-tripartite.pdf

Basically the motivation of the research is to understand how to keep data relatively secure in application
context. Also thinking about protocols to enforce things. 

## Ideas around Decentralized Cryptography UX

This seems like a very hard problem at the moment. Having centralized or custodial keys is fairly
easy to manage cryptography. But I don't want to put trust in a third party. That seems like a 
major problem to me. 

There is not an easy way around this problem as far as I can see. Wallets certainly shouldnt just
be able to decrypt everything without you knowing. The problem with this is that an application
could just decrypt everything you have a key for and store it on their server. So I don't consider
this a satisfactory application. Again maybe FHE has some application here.

So far there are some temporary UX hacks I have:

* Basically we have a "Root" encryption key, which is derived from your private key.
  * Anyone can send you a message and you can decrypt it.
* Each application comes up with it's own encryption public/private key pair. 
  * All data for the application could be encrypted with this (or a secret key encrypted with it).. all files share secret
  * Alternatively can generate new secret key for each data piece.
  * Other applications could not decrypt the data. Unless they request access.

I am not really a fan of this solution.

What would be the ideal thing to happen then?
