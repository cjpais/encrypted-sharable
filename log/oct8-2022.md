Basically getting the repo set up at the moment. Building it from scratch. I
might want to make my own scaffold eventually. This might be a good repo
to base it off of. Nothing fancy or special in this case.

## Sharing

Some questions arising around the sharing. 

One would be how to not allow someone else to share the file once they 
have the key. Well we can block this in the contract. If they share
things after being decrypted anyway, then that's a breach of human trust.
That is not a problem we are solving.

The next question is, what if I want to let multiple people, a group of people
be able to share the file that I let them in on? Well we can have a function
to do this. Simple. 

The file can be in 3 modes in terms of sharing:
  * only owner, only allowed, anyone with key

In terms of abstraction this boils down to the same list, so it doesn't matter.

## On-Chain/Off-Chain

There's a fundamental difference between something being onchain and encrypted
versus being off-chain and encrypted. 

**On-chain** probably implies the data itself as stored is encrypted.

**Off-chain** implies that the data on-chain is not encrypted, but the data
off chain is encrypted.

## Encryption

Encryption can be done in 3 modes.

Unencryped (public), encrypted (private), encrypted (shared).

Unencrypted implies that there is no key added. 

## Implementation

I am going to start with the simplist implementation first. This one is less
abstract and perhaps easier to read and reason about. It is probably ultimately
the wrong approach, but it is a good starting point. Exploring the problem.

## Reality-Check

The reality of this problem is hard right now. There is no concrete EIP
which allows for this built into wallets. The closest thing is (EIP-5630)[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5630]. But no one is implementing it yet.

The options to continue to move forward with this are as follows:

1. Use metamask eth_encrypt and eth_decrypt. This will in addition require storing the user's public key on the chain as well. Metamask derives a public key from a user's private key. This seems pretty silly to me. But would be a way to have a proof-of-concept
2. Wait for EIP-5630 and advocate for it. Perhaps adding tweaks.
3. Burner wallets using `eth-crypto`

## Further notes

doing a lot of looking into this today. the standards for eth encryption are quite varied. [EIP 5630](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5630-encryption-and-decryption/10761) may help to resolve some of these things, but the discussion is quite contentious at the moment.

The problem is less on the contract side but more on the wallet and security side. Considering 2 options to move forward currently:

* Implement Burner Wallets on the frontend as a proof of concept.
* Use Metamask's deprecated API's to implement something like this. The problem is they use a non standard version of encrypt, so the public key would have to be generated for every wallet who wants to participate in the system and put onto the blockchain. This is okay, but a very hacky solution overall. Again it would certainly be enough as a proof of concept but would not last long term

Regardless I would like to go for one of these options to move forward. Will probably clear my head a bit and pick one that seems right. I don't think right now I can go wrong with either. I am currently leaning towards the metamask approach, the UX will be somewhat painful for someone, but might be a necessary evil while I advocate for EIP 5630.
